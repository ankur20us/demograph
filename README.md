# demograph 
This is basically an example of Using the graph with Java

I have used already available library called JGraphT with Maven via:

<dependency>
	<groupId>org.jgrapht</groupId>
	<artifactId>jgrapht-core</artifactId>
	<version>0.9.1</version>
</dependency>

The project contains 2 files:

	1. A file with just an example 
	2. Snake and Ladder program using graph
