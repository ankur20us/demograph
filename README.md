This is basically an example of Using the graph with Java

I have used already available library called JGraphT with Maven at http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jgrapht. Please look on to this once. It is a good library.

The project contains 2 files:

	1. A file with just an example 
	2. Snake and Ladder program using graph
